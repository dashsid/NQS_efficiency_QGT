This repository contains the datafiles for the article "Efficiency of neural quantum states in light of the quantum geometric tensor" (arXiv:2402.01565).

The data files for the infidelity minimization runs are in the folder manuscript_data/data_infidelity_optimization/.

The data files for the VMC optimization runs are in the folder manuscript_data/data_VMC_optimization/.

The folder manuscript_data/example/ contains example scripts to run VMC optimization (run_test_VMC.py) and infidelity minimization (run_test_infid.py) for the spin-1 Bilinear Biquadratic chain.

The python scripts used to produce the plots used in the article are in the folder manuscript_data/ and are named as "fig_n.py" for nth figure in the article.
